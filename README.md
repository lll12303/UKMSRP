# UKMSRP: Multimodal Long-term Stroke Risk Prediction

This repository contains the full implementation of the UK Multimodal Stroke Risk Prediction (UKMSRP) project.
It provides a complete and modular pipeline for:

Feature preprocessing

Follow-up time computation

Unimodal model training

Model evaluation (AUC / DeLong test)

End-to-end demonstration with synthetic data

The codebase is organized in a clean, reproducible, and modular structure, designed for easy extension to other omics modalities or other diseases.
